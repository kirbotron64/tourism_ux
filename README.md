This repository hosts a GitHub Pages site designed to showcase a mobile app prototype focused on UI/UX design. The site provides an interactive preview of the app’s interface, allowing users to explore its layout, navigation, and core design elements.

### UI/UX-Focused – Highlights design choices, animations, and usability
### Mobile-Friendly – Optimized for responsive viewing on various devices
### Hosted on GitHub Pages – Easily accessible for demos and feedback

This project serves as a presentation tool for stakeholders, testers, and developers, making it easy to showcase and refine the prototype before full-scale development.
